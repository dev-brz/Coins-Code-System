Approaches to running Cypress E2E tests

- Run `ng e2e` to serve an application and then execute tests via Cypress UI.
- Run `ng run coins-code-ui:cypress-run` to serve an application and then execute tests automatically (without Cypress UI).
- Run `npm run cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:run` to run tests without serving an application.
